# The World Exchange

Very simple, "vanilla" site demonstrating much of Ripple/XRP's capabilities through their API, including but not limited to:
- Trading of symbols (buy/sell)
- Issuing new symbols, including Ripple's KYC features like allowing only authorized token holders.
- Sending/receiving symbols
- Bid/ask orderbooks for any symbol with autobridging implemented to connect all XRP-traded symbols.
- Fully client-side implementation for all the benefits of a "cold wallet" (no storing or passing of information on remote servers), including the ability to both generate and verify valid wallets/addresses completely offline by saving the webpage to your desktop.
- Bonus: Chat box feature running entirely on Ripple, decentralized and stored forever, doubles as a free notary because nothing can ever be changed or removed once it's up.
- Bonus 2: Ripple Names is back and re-implemented entirely on the ledger.

We welcome others to improve on the code and share; we're happy to update the site with any code improvements others make (after review etc of course).  The site already is and always has been open-source by the fact that it's just pure HTML/Javascript, which anyone can right-click the page while viewing and see the source on.  At the very least, it should be helpful as working examples for much of Ripple's API functionality.
