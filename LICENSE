NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY. The World Exchange is not an actual exchange or even a "web wallet" for cryptocurrencies. You do not create an account or give us your funds to hold onto. All transactions are signed locally, and no private or secret keys ever leave your browser / computer. The site merely acts as a user-interface to interact with blockchain, specifically the Ripple network. You agree by using the site that you cannot and will not hold the creators or operators of The World Exchange liable for anything, whether for breach of contract, negligence or otherwise, and whether or not the creators or operators of The World Exchange were advised of the possibility of any liability you may experience

SECURITY. The World Exchange website does not include its own encryption or other security measures, and any communications with Ripple via The World Exchange website are protected only by any security that Ripple (or other third parties) may provide. You are responsible for your own security of your keys and transactions whether generated by this site or not. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that all communications conducted via the World Exchange website are secure and neither The World Exchange nor its creators or operators shall have any responsibility for interception or other unauthorized access to communications conducted via The World Exchange website. While best effort has been made to build The World Exchange in a secure manner, there is always the possibility of loss from software bugs or other security flaws that may have been overlooked, and you agree by using the site that you understand this risk and hold The World Exchange, its creators, or its operators harmless for anything that may occur. You also acknowledge and are aware of the proliferation of computer viruses and other malware affecting the internet, and are solely responsible to scan any and all downloaded materials received from Ripple or other portions of the Internet to ensure that such viruses or other malware do not affect your computer or other IT systems. Neither The World Exchange nor its creators or operators are not responsible or liable for any damage caused by such hazards, and The World Exchange website does not include any anti-virus or anti-malware protections to prevent such hazards.

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, REGULATIONS, and TAXATION RULES. You are solely responsible for abiding by the laws, regulatory requirements, and taxation rules of your jurisdiction for what you choose to do with The World Exchange, including Securities laws and regulations. Tokens on the platform may be subject to taxation rules depending on local and federal laws, which you are solely repsonsible for knowing. Any violations of the laws are liable to you, the end user, only and will not be the responsibility of The World Exchange, its creators, or its operators. Lastly, you acknowledge that there is substantial legal and regulatory risk in dealing with blockchain-based tokens, as the landscape for such technologies is constantly evolving, and this risk is similarly solely your own responsibility. Should you be unsure of the legality or regulatory requirements of your intended use of The World Exchange, you should immediately stop all use and first consult an attorney or legal counsel.

INDEMNIFICATION. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the creators and operators of The World Exchange and their affiliates, their licensors, and the officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, service providers, successors and assigns of the foregoing from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising from or relating to your use or misuse of The World Exchange. 

NO INVESTMENT ADVICE. You agree that to the extent you purchase tokens or other assets via Ripple, the seller of such tokens or assets is solely responsible for creating or providing all information and/or documentation relevant and necessary to assess and execute the purchase of such tokens or assets (including without limitation any document describing the tokens or assets (sometimes referred to as a “whitepaper”) and any contract memorializing such purchase of tokens or assets) and that The World Exchange does not, and neither The World Exchange nor its creators or operators have any responsibility or obligation to do so.	You understand that The World Exchange, its creators, and its operators provide no transaction or investment advice of any kind, nor do The World Exchange, its creators, or its operators give advice or offer any opinion with respect to the nature, potential value or suitability of any particular transaction or investment strategy. You understand that you are solely responsible for all transaction and investment decisions you make using The World Exchange. You further understand that while you may be able to access market data and other financial information using The World Exchange, the availability of such information does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell anything or to engage in any investment strategy. Any transactions you conduct or investment decisions you make will be based solely on your own evaluation of your financial circumstances and investment objectives and the suitability for you of any asset or any investment strategy. Any transaction conducted by you or using your login credentials is yours and you are responsible for any outcome resulting from transactions that you initiate or that are initiated by any third party using your login credentials, including the possible loss of principal invested based on an investment decision. You understand the risks involved with transacting via Ripple and that investments in tokens and other assets will fluctuate in value, and you agree that neither The World Exchange nor its creators or operators are responsible for any losses you may incur as a result of your investment decisions or any transactions that you may conduct using The World Exchange website. All investments and other transactions have risks, and you are responsible for determining whether you can afford the risks of making any investment or other transaction. 

GOVERNING LAW.
